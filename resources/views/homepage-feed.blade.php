        <h2>Hello <strong>{{auth()->user()->username}}</strong>, send a regear.</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">If this is your first time to request a regear dont worry; just click on the menu up top and go make a request. Once your officers approve your request they will supply it back in-game.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">And since this is for a Regear service, this site does not record the quality of your gear; only its enchantment level.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">If your guild is interested in using this system go to the footer and checkout how to contact me. Since the website is free i&rsquo;de gladly accept donations for server upkeep.</p>
