# RegearRequest

We develop this web app for Albion "ZvZ" players to easily send requests to their guild officers. In Albion, guilds has a public feature called "Regearable Content", when players die in pvp zones they drop all the gear and equipment they are holding. 

So during this content it is standard for Guilds to reimburse their players on items lost to keep them joining hosted contents similar to this. RegearRequest makes all this simple by making it a point an click feature.

This web app is also a learning platform I developed to sharpen my coding skills. 

All assets used in game are credited to Albion Online and their awesome developers in SBI.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I used to develop web apps for Fintech applications before switching industries, this is my way to review and relearn the skills I had before. Im not developing full time anymore so beside basic CRUD stuff I want to have built in features to explore new tech in a couple languages.
